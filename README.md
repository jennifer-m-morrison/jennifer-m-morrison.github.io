2.  I'm a collaborative web developer and a student at Wake Tech Community College. This is my space for sharing projects and assignments from my courses.

3. This repository contains assignments for my Wake Tech web development classes.

4. When I opened the Github Desktop application, the repository for my ResumeAssignment project for my Web210 class was open in the display window. Under the "Current Repository" tab, I clicked the arrow beside the ResumeAssignment title to open a pop-up window that listed all my repositories. Beside the filter input box I clicked the "Add" button and then selected the "Clone Repository" option. From the Clone Repository popup window, I selected the repository I wanted to clone from the list of my respositories. In the local path section, I selected the folder on my computer where I wanted the files to be added. As a last step, I clicked the "Clone" button to copy the files from Github to my local machine.
